Install Directions:
    Need to install Imdb before importing and running my program.

Program Description:
    My program gets the top 250 shows from IMDB using an api key
    and writes their information to an output file. The program
    also gets the IDs for the 1st, 50th, 100th and 200th ranked
    shows and displays their ratings data. The program also
    displays the ratings data for the show 'Wheel of time'.
    My program also creates a database and then creates 2
    tables in that database. The first table is for the top
    250 shows data and the second table is for the ratings data
    for 5 shows. My program will then add this data into the
    tables in the database. I also wrote a test to ensure that
    I retrieved 250 data items for the top 250 shows.

Missing:
    My program is missing the second automated test. My first
    test runs and executes correctly on pycharm but fails on
    github. Everything else on github actions passes.
