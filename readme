Program Description:
    My program gets the top 250 shows from IMDB using an api key
    and writes their information to an output file. The program
    also gets the IDs for the 1st, 50th, 100th and 200th ranked
    shows and displays their ratings data. The program also
    displays the ratings data for the show 'Wheel of time'.
    My program also creates a database and then creates 2
    tables in that database. The first table is for the top
    250 shows data and the second table is for the ratings data
    for 5 shows. My program will then add this data into the
    tables in the database. I also wrote a test to ensure that
    I retrieved 250 data items for the top 250 shows. My program
    now also gets the data for the top 250 movies, the most popular
    movies, the 3 highest positive changed movies and the lowest
    changed movies and then I got the ranking data for these 4 movies.
    With this data, my program created 4 new tables in my database
    to store all the data for the movies.

Missing:
    My program is missing the tests for sprint 3. Im having
    trouble understanding them and I wasn't able to figure them
    out in time.
