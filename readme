Install Directions:
    Need to install Imdb before importing and running my program.

Program Description:
    My program gets the top 250 shows from IMDB using an api key
    and writes their information to an output file. The program
    also gets the IDs for the 1st, 50th, 100th and 200th ranked
    shows and displays their ratings data. The program also
    displays the ratings data for the show 'Wheel of time'.
